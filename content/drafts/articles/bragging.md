When I first came to uni, it was exciting to explore a new environment of friends and culture. I learned a lot, not only regarding academic content but also emotional intelligence. Retrospectively, I don't like the person to which I was evolving back in that time, at least regading my character traits. Don't get me wrong, I think that I still was a reasonably decent person, but there was one character trait emerging which was not pleasant at all: a subtle but present urge to brag.

In this article, we shall explore this character trait


- what I was bragging about
- personal experience with bragging behaviour
  - I had just moved to a foreign country and felt insecure and disoriented.
- imposter syndrome
- individualism
- urbanism poem
- why
  - insecure -> seeking approval
- reactions to bragging
  - annoyance -> just don't do it
- is it just English culture?
   - general studies about bragging -> when insecure, new students feel insecure
- what's the difference between telling awesome facts about you in an interview vs friends
  - interview -> not bragging, selling yourself
  - friends -> bragging
  - difference: what the recipient is expecting to hear
- empathy gap
  - if you're v happy it becomes difficult for us to imagine how it feels like to experience negative feelings
  - usually bragging about an achievement, a good grade etc. which makes you feel good, happy
  - underestimating how recipients react emotionally (negatively) to bragging
