# Swimming Against the Current of Input Overflow

Last year, I started to use tools like RSS and email newsletters to ...

- lots of distractions in the internet
- goal: spend less time on unnecessary things, more time on things you actually enjoy
- rss feeds: it does not make sense to give a number of websites you should monitor since their publishing speed can differ from a couple of times a day to once a few months... find your own sweetspot by thinking about how much time are you willing to put into reading
- similar to everything in life, the more something piles up, the more hesitant we're to start working on it, until we either crack or we have a stressful time trying to catch up
  - Example: deadline -> use this as opener
    - The longer we wait to do the work necessary, the more work we need to do each day until the deadline (this would make a great sketch!)

- On a side note: rediscovering the joy of writing
  - this article might not have cost me the most effort / .. like other articles, I wasn't even sure if it would be worth it to finish and publish it. One evening I just opened up my text editor and started writing again. Sometimes it's just about bringing the stone to rolling again.
- After not publishing anything in four months, it felt great to finish an article and bring it online. Similar to that feeling when you finish a handwritten letter, address the envelope and finally seal. But who write's letters in the modern age anyway?
