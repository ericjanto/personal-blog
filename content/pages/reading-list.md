The purpose of a reading list is not to have a rigid reading plan.
It's rather a first reference point if you happen to be in the situation that you don't have any idea what to read
next.

I have included an 'already read' list, not because I'm trying to show off what books I've read – that'd be absolutely nonsense as
it's not about whether someone has read a book but more about _how the reader engaged with it_. No, that list is merely more than
a progress tracker to remind myself from time to time that I do read more than it sometimes appears to me, which can be a nice feeling.

I'm always open to new book recommendations, feel free to [contact](/contact/) me.
