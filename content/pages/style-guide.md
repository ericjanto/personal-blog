Sometimes you will find in my book notes references. For most cases, I will try to stick to the author-date style according to the [Chicago Manual of Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html).

By including the author, the publishing date of the book and the page numbers, the author-date style allows the writer to reference without using footnotes (Lab n.d., 2).
The reader can then look up the source in the reference list at the end of the article.

Depending on the context, some information can be omitted. For example, if I always referred to the same book, it would be sufficient to only use page numbers as reference.

Since I don't have paper versions of all of my books, I tend to use Apples Books application on macOS for reading ebooks. This comes with the complication of fluid page numbers: Depending on the window size, the page numbers change. For consistent page references, my page numbers refer to the book opened in *actual size mode* (`cmd + O`).
