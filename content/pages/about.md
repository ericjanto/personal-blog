Hello! I'm an undergraduate studying Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. I'm interested in web development, spaced-repitition systems, and UI design. My interests tend to shift quickly though, at the moment I'm heading towards interpreters and compilers. When I'm not busy with my degree, I swim a lot and play music together with other people.
