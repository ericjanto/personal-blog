## Music

I try to play the piano and the violin on a daily basis,
it helps me to calm down and gives variety to the demanding
student life.

I'm currently enjoying my time in two different orchestras:

- [Edinburgh University String Orchestra](https://string.eusa.ed.ac.uk/)
- [Edinburgh University Chamber Orchestra](https://www.facebook.com/EdinburghUniversityChamberOrchestra)
