These days I spend most of my time studying AI & Computer Science in Edinburgh.
I also play lots of music, and hike up Arthur's seat from time to time.

### Education

Naah this page contains only personal information. Have a look at my [CV](https://www.ericjanto.com/cv) if you're interested in my educational background.

### Music

I play the piano and the violin, the latter in two orchestras:

- [Edinburgh University String Orchestra](https://string.eusa.ed.ac.uk/)
- [Edinburgh University Chamber Orchestra](https://www.eusa.ed.ac.uk/activities/societies/society/euco/)

Here are some pieces I'm practicing at the moment:

- Fuga, Sonata I, Bach
- En avril, à Paris. Original song by Charles Trenet, transcription by Weissenberg.
- Ballade No. 4, Chopin.

### Spoon List

Non-exhausitve. I like to call my bucket list 'spoon list' since in German, we have this weird idiom 'den Löffel abgeben' which means literally 'to give away the spoon'. It's an analogy to 'to kick the bucket' and we say that when someone dies. So my spoon list contains all the things I want to get done before I give away my spoon.

Oh, I also like hammocks and [reading](/books/).
