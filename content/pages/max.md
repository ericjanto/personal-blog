The remarks below should get you up to speed to be able to converse with any girl about classical music at a sophisticated level, no matter her knowledge level about the topic ;)

## Basics

### Classical Music Terminology

- refer to a specific piece of music using "piece", not "song"
  - unless someone is singing, then it's a "song", e.g. [An die Musik](https://open.spotify.com/track/2cMcZgAIZS0ZafdW1MDYKU?si=ef8d5c992f664bcd), one of my favourite songs
  - or if you want to be fancy, you can refer to songs (not pieces) as "chansons"
- important to get this right when you're talking to music people because that's the most common mistake people make and it hurts haha

### Composers You Should Know

Famous composers you should know the names of:

- Bach
  - "Invented" lots of rules which are still standard in classical music today
  - His _well-tempered clavier_ is standard literature for the piano
- Mozart
  - He too "invented" lots of rules which are still standard
  - Zauberflöte, kleine Nachtmusik
- Chopin
  - Probably the greatest composer for piano music of all time, most of his repertoire is written for piano only
  - If you haven't watched it yet, watch _The Pianist_, the pianist in there plays almost only Chopin exclusively
- Beethoven
  - _The_ symphony composer (he was the only one of the great composers known to finish 9 symphonies, all others who have tried died before finishing their last one so for a long time they stopped trying)
  - Also famous for his piano sonatas
- Schubert
- Schumann
- Mendelssohn
  - His sister Fanny Mendelssohn was a good composer and pianist too, but because she was a woman, most of her work never ended up being published, or was published under her brother's name, Felix Mendelssohn
- Debussy
  - Known as the first "impressionist" composer so you'll notice that his style is completely different than for example Mozart's
  - You may know his "Clair de Lune"
- Mahler
  - Very well known for his 5th symphony, I didn't add it to the playlist though because it is a tough listen (majestic and epic though)
- Gershwin
  - His style is probably described best by "the intersection between classical music and jazz", he was a pioneer for his time (20th century) and his compositional style is still unique today
  - I've played "The Man I love" for you on the piano the other day, so you already know his music
- Any composers on your playlist

## How to Listen to Classical Music

You might not like the pieces but give them a chance and keep listening to the playlist over and over again, you'll get to know the pieces and learn to appreciate certain nuances and harmonics, even if you don't fully understand what's going on. Also, the good thing about classical music is that it's so complex that it'll take ages to get tired of it, I can keep listening to the same piece for months without it growing annoying.

## Playlist Remarks

I have included a few lesser-known pieces but be ensured that all of them are known by people who are into classical music, and all of them are amazing pieces of work.

| Song                                             | Remark                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _Serenade for Strings (Dvorák)_                  | One of the more famous choices for string orchestras, they play it in the Netflix series "Unorthodox" for a few seconds (you should watch it if you haven't so yet, it's amazing).                                                                                                     |
| _Rêverie_ (Debussy)                              | Probably Debussy's 2nd most famous piece after Claire de Lune. Plays a key role in the soundtrack for the HBC show "Westworld".                                                                                                                                                        |
| _Nocturne No. 2 (Chopin)_                        | All of Chopin's nocturnes are superb (they're what I listen to all the time), I'd recommend listening to all of them at some point, also good study music in the background. This one is the most famous of them. Listen to how music can be sad yet beautiful.                        |
| _Symphony No. 7, 2nd Movement (Beethoven)_       | Great music, this movement is known to be used in movies because it's so dramatic, e.g. in [this scene of Westworld](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0dNLHCDCbs)                                                                                                                      |
| _Morceaux de Fantaisie, No. 2 (Rachmaninoff)_    | Famous opus for piano by Rachmaninoff, the No. 2 is very famous and good.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| _Prelude No. 1 (Gershwin)_                       | Not my favourite piece but doesn't hurt to know it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| _Claire de Lune (Debussy)_                       | Most common people know this one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| _Gymnopédie No 1. (Satie)_                       | Most common people know this one too because the YouTube algorithm kept hyping it.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| _Piano Concerto No 1. (Tchaikovsky)_             | One of the more famous piano concertos.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| _Ständchen (Liszt)_                              | Originally a song but Liszt transcribed it to a piano piece, it's just beautiful.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| _Pavane pour une infante défunte (Ravel)_        | Oskar plays this one at the moment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| _Cello Suite No. 1 (Bach)_                       | You probably know this one already.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| _Sonata No. 3 (Beethoven)_                       | This is where the _Twinkle Twinkle Little Star_ melody comes from!                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| _Piano Concerto No. 5, 2nd Movement (Beethoven)_ | One of my favourites, appears in movies often too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| _Salut d' Amour (Elgar)_                         | Susannah and I love playing this together.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| _Symphony No. 9 (Dvorák)_                        | Also known as the "New World" symphony. Very famous piece for orchestras, I've played it myself.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| _Má Vlast (Smetana)_                             | One of the few composers on the playlist you don't need to know. But the symphony is great, it's better known as _The Moldau_ (that river which flows through Prague. I think?). If you keep the image of a river in your mind while listening to it, the music will make a lot of sense. |
| _Nocturne No. 20 (Chopin)_                       | Another one of his nocturnes. One of his sister's had died a few years ago, and this one is dedicated to his other sister. I like to think that he was thinking of his passed-away sister whilst composing this piece, but that's not a known fact.                                    |
| _Ave Maria (Gounod)_                             | No need to know this composer. I think the piece is originally a song, the melody composed by Gounod who took the piano part from Bach's _Well-tempered Clavier_                                                                                                                       |
| _Méditation from Thais (Massenet)_               | I played this a few years ago at a concert, most violinists know it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| _Romance in F Minor (Dvorák)_                    | Nothing really to say here except it's a beautiful piece.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| _Libertango (Piazzolla)_                         | Fun to play, well-known.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| _Rhapsody in Blue (Gershwin)_                    | Gershwin's most famous and well-recognised work, I always wanted to play this on the piano, and I will one day.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| _Vocalise (Rachmaninoff)_                        | A pretty piece by Rachmaninoff which is untypical for his style.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| _An die Musik (Schubert)_                        | My favourite chanson, its lyrics are very nice. They basically say how important music is.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| _Cavalleria Rusicana: Intermezzo (Mascagni)_     | Not that well-known but one of my favourites.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| _The Man I Love (Gershwin)_                      | The harmony is a homage to his great _Rhapsody in Blue_. Originally a song but more successful as the piano version.                                                                                                                                                                 |
