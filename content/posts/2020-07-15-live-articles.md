_This article itself is a live article hehe_

### Draft 15th July 2020

Today, I had this idea: articles on my website which aren't complete yet.

Usage:

- Article about project -> update with each step / milestone

Purpose:

- if something is already out there, people will expect me to finish it -> it's less likely that I won't finish a project
- close to learning in public concept
- more content is more quickly accessible for this blog's readers

But: Live articles should have a certain amount of content to begin with, otherwise the reader might end up in front of an incoherent draft.

Technical:

- Date Stamps
- Update post date -> rss feed update (test this)
- Never edit older content of post (except minor edits like fixing typos, correcting grammar)
- Looses live-blog status once it's done
