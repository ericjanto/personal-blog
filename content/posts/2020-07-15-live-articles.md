*This article itself is a live article hehe*

### Draft 15th July 2020

Today, I had this idea: articles on my website which aren't complete yet.

Usage:
  - Article about project -> update with each step / milestone

Purpose:
  - if something is already out there, people will expect me to finish it -> it's less likely that I won't finish a project
  - close to learning in public concept


Technical:
  - Date Stamps
  - Update post date -> rss feed update (test this)
  - Never edit older content of post (except minor edits like fixing typos, correcting grammar)
