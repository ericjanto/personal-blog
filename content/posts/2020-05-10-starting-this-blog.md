... not another blog!\
Well, I couldn't agree more with you. Surely, there are enough blogs around the web,
covering every single topic one can think of. You know what? I don't care. This blog
isn't even meant to be read by any people. There is a variety of different reasons why
I started it.

## Broo, why?

Before I started planning this blog out, I asked myself:

> "Yo, do you really want to invest hours of your life starting
this blog? Why don't you just watch Netflix?"

Since I'm quite pragmatic in making such decisions, I divided the reasons into
two categories: **Purpose** and **Goals**.

### Purpose

- Learning by writing
- Improve my English skills
- Enforce a productive structure onto my chaotic student life
- Have some place to display and write about my projects
- Watch less Netflix (that's a hard one, let's be honest)

### Goals

- Create a library of knowledge such that I can come back here, should I forget
something (the [forgetting-curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve)
is the student's biggest enemy)
- Inspire people to study computer science (it's great)
- Motivate myself to study more CS topics in depth ([learning in public](/learn)-concept)


## What can I expect?

- Articles in tutorial form
- Newsletter about a more general topic ([example](/example))

Both a new article and a newsletter email go online **on Sundays**, in a biweekly manner.

### Topics I'll be writing about

- Student life
- Computer Science
	- Everything my [degree](/me) covers
	- Everything that interests me
	- Swift development since that's what I'm going for atm
- Artificial Intelligence
- Whatever I want hehe


## Inspiration

- Basically every CS student having a blog (they made me want to have one too)
- Tania Rascia's blog (thank you for making your gatsby theme [open-source](https://github.com/taniarascia/taniarascia.com))

## Conclusion

Well, that's it for now. I'm excited, how all of this will turn out eventually.
Writing all of this while having lots of time (due to [CoVid-19](link)) will be
totally different to maintaining this blog once the next semester has started.
I guess, I'll just have to watch some [Ali Abdaal videos](link) to stay productive!
